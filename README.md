# Energy Demand Forecasting Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting future energy consumption using time series forecasting techniques. Accurately forecasting energy demand is crucial for energy providers to balance supply and demand, optimize resource allocation, and plan for peak usage periods. The project is designed to showcase fundamental data science and time series forecasting skills.

## Objectives

- To predict energy demand based on historical consumption data
- To analyze seasonal patterns and trends in energy usage
- To explore the application of time series forecasting model ARIMA

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains historical energy consumption data. 
- **Notebooks**: Includes the main notebook (`code_for_Energy_Demand_Forecasting.ipynb`) with code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
- **Models**: Trained models used for energy demand forecasting.
- **Results**: Contains visualizations and evaluation metrics for the forecasting models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
